Yes, I agree about Item class, you can also override the toString method there.
I personally would not create a database class,
instead I would simply create some kind of Collections (think which one suites this task best)
of Items and pass these collections as parameters to Invoice.

For the sake of this example, our Main class would act as "database" :)

But, once again, you can certainly add some other parts, that would be a good practice.

LinkedHashMap?

Any type of Map is like a table with two columns: key and value:

KEY     |    VALUE
--------------------
key1    |   value1
key2    |   value2
key3    |   value3

Since in this example and item itself carries information about its name,
description and price (this is at least how I would implement it),
thus I don't see what kind of value we would keep in such a map (if a key is Item).
That's why I would use some other sort of Collection (the choice is between List and Set).
